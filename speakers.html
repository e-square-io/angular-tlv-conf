          <p class="description">
            At the core of Angular lies a fascinating process - how it updates
            the DOM. This process, known as change detection, is pivotal for the
            framework's performance and success. I am going to unravel the
            intricacies of change detection, zone.js, dirty marking, OnPush, and
            Signals. Additionally, I'll explore the groundbreaking zoneless mode
            introduced in Angular 18, providing insights and live coding
            demonstrations to empower you in customizing these mechanisms to
            suit your requirements.

            No matter what tests you implement, sooner or later, you will
            eventually need "Test Doubles". But what is a "Test Double"? A
            jargon for saying "Mock" or more than that? Although attractive,
            especially in the JS ecosystem, some "Test Doubles" can make our
            tests more expensive to maintain while harming their readability.
            They can also over-specify our tests and couple them to
            implementation details... even worse, they can end up discouraging
            us from implementing new tests, or even pushing us to get rid of
            some of them. Oops. I don't have much room to tell you the rest
            here, but I'll see you at Angular TLV to tell you how "Fakes" and
            their faithful companions "Object Mothers" and "Gloves" end up
            becoming the pillars of your testing strategy.

          <p class="description">
            When we write a component library for internal company use or as
            open source, we want to minimize any breaking changes to prevent
            hurting our users' productivity, but sometimes it's inevitable. In
            these cases, we can create detailed documentation explaining what
            and where to change, but we can take it a step further. Angular has
            a build-it mechanism that allows us to automatically update the
            user's code when they update our library. In this session, we will
            learn what “ng update” does and what tools we can use to implement

          <p class="description">
            Organizing code into files is crucial. Once in files, you need to
            import. More files? Libs are becoming useful, but do you know what
            different export styles do to the bundle size? How do they affect
            performance? We are about to find out. Topics: import & export, ESM,
            CJS, barrel files, bundle-size, Nx libs Talks wraps up experience of
            bundle size optimization with file import structure organization and
            Nx libraries use-cases from import boundaries, avoiding cyclic
            dependencies to impact different export strategies on your bundles.
