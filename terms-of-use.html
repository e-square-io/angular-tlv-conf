          systems, procedures, and standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since the site operates in an online environment, the Angular

          If, due to force majeure, the Angular TLV Conf or its representatives
          are unable to manage the purchase of products and services on the site
          properly, the Angular TLV Conf may cancel transactions with users.
          Force majeure includes events beyond the Angular TLV Conf control that
          prevent or delay site activities and the supply of products/services,
          including computer system failures, phone system failures, other

        <p>
          For the avoidance of doubt, the cancellation or postponement of
          activities ordered on the site due to the War constitutes "force
          majeure," and in such cases, the Angular TLV Conf will not be liable,
          nor will it be required to pay any compensation or remedy.

          read the terms, understand its provisions, and agree to and accept the
