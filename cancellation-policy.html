      <div class="customer-cancallation">
        <h3>Cancellation by the consumer</h3>
        <p>
          Our transaction cancellation policy complies with the Consumer
          Protection (Cancellation of Transactions) Law, 2016. According to the
          law, a transaction can be canceled by notifying the event organizer
          within 14 days from the date of the transaction, provided that the
          cancellation is made no later than 7 days, excluding rest days, before
          the event date. After canceling the transaction, the customer is
          entitled to a refund within 14 days from the date of receiving the
          cancellation notice, based on the actual amount paid, less a
          cancellation fee of 5% of the transaction price or 100 NIS, whichever
          is lower. According to Amendment No. 47, 2016, a transaction can be
          canceled by a consumer who is a person with a disability, a senior
          citizen, or a new immigrant within 4 months from the date of the
          transaction, provided that they present a document indicating their
          status as a person with a disability, a senior citizen, or a new
          immigrant. Notwithstanding the above, it is clarified that the event
          organizer bears the cost of credit card processing fees for the
          transaction (credit clearing fee). In any case of cancellation, the
          event organizer will not refund the cost it incurred for the
          transaction, which is approximately 5% of the credit card transaction
          amount or 100 NIS, whichever is lower.
